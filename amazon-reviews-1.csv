And they do not contain iron, so they won’t upset your stomach like prenatal vitamins that do contain iron (be sure to get your nonheme iron from your diet- beans, spinach, etc.!).  And I like the ingredients.  I wanted a vitamin that was free of soy, dairy, peanuts, wheat, and GMO’s, and these are free of all of those and more!  The vitamins and minerals are excellent for prenatal health and for breastfeeding support.

"United States","🇺🇸","2018-09-12","false","580","B07C2BHFCN","4","Unfortunately I have to give these vitamins by Mama Bear only 4 stars, after input from my 3 year old.My personal opinion is a 5 star review.  They taste great, are affordable, and have a very short and natural ingredient list.My 3 old, strangely enough, refuses to eat them.  She actually spit them out, which I honestly couldn't believe.  She has had both the Paw Patrol gummie vitamins that you can get at Wal-Mart and the Zarbee's gummie vitamins off of Amazon, and likes both of these (prefers the Paw Patrol of course).The Mama Bear Organic Kids Multivitamin gummies are shaped similar to the Dots candy, and at first they feel like they're going to be a hard texture (and possibly a choking hazard) but after you bite into them, they're suprisingly soft and very similar to the texture of a Swedish Fish candy.  And they literally taste just like candy.  If I REALLY concentrate, I can detect a very subtle ""vitamin"" taste, and maybe my daughter's taste buds are way more sensitive than mine, but I think these things are absolutely delicious!!The serving for my daughter's age is 2 gummies per day, whereas her other vitamins she only gets one gummie.  Her loss I guess - it looks like the Mama Bear vitamins are mine.  Or maybe I'll be nice and save them to see if she acquires a taste for them in a couple of months (if I can resist eating them all!).I'm disappointed my daughter doesn't like these.  I think they're a good choice of vitamin for our little ones and would absolutely buy them in the future if she decides to try them again and likes them.Two thumbs up from this mama, and two thumbs down from my 3 year old.  Keep in mind, she also doesn't like mashed potatoes....so that goes to show you how poor her taste in flavors is. :)",,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Great flavor, great texture, simple ingredients","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGJZ3ZC7LFWTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07C2BHFCN","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 12, 2018","Style: Multivitamin Only"

It’s nonGMO, organic and appears to have reasonable daily values and lacks a bunch of filler.  This vitamin isn’t derived from whole foods and is instead synthetically derived like most vitamins. It doesn’t have filler or junk like artificial dyes, and it uses fruit pectin instead of gelatin (usually derived from pork skin). I prefer pectin to gelatin myself.This multi contains Vitamin D2 from ergocalciferol (an irradiated plant derived material) instead of Vitamin D3 as cholecalciferol (derived from lanolin in sheep’s wool).  Experts like Dr. Weil recommend that even vegans take D3 as cholecalciferol as it’s more effective than D2. My son isn’t vegan, so I wouldn’t choose this multi that lacks D3 for him. But for those with a diet incompatible with taking D3, this seems like a good kid’s multivitamin. 4 stars.",,,,,"One person found this helpful","Good Kid’s Multivitamin For Vegans Who Can’t Take Vitamin D3- This Has Less Effective Vitamin D2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDVRH3S4BOPE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07C2BHFCN","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 15, 2018","Style: Multivitamin Only"

Now I realize why.These have synthetic folate (folic acid) and who knows what else fake as it's very hard to research vitamins (many sites just say something is 'a form' of a vitamins without telling you it's a natural form or not) and the folic acid is all I need to know.

At this price point I was willing to take a gamble and see if my kid likes these. I figure hell if they dont like them, then I can take these :) Cant let them go to waste after all.+ Great price point+ Has all the vitamin ingredients that I would want+ My kid loves the taste+ I get an extra discount when I subscribe and save: %5 monthly if just for this one product, but you can also get up to a %15 discount when you subscribe and save on multiple products.+ Delivered right to my door, no need to go get them.- NONE!As of right now I cant beat the price or taste therefore these will be our product of choice for the time being.
